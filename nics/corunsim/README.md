# CorunSim (Corundum x SimBricks)

This is an extraction of the SimBricks implementation of Corundum with its various patches and whatnot. All the SimBricks content resides in the `interface/`.

>Read more about the [`interface/` folder](./interface/README.md).

The same version of Corundum used in the old version of SimBricks is included here as a submodule, so that if you want to run the SimBricks-extracted Corundum implementation, you can:

Commit `d0c9a83752cde7715787aa31a5bb951fc808e0cc` from https://github.com/corundum/corundum.

I can confirm that this is not plug-and-play with the latest version of Corundum, I have a lot of patches for this exact endeavour, that'll likely be deprecated, in the [`patches/`](../../containers/patches/) directory.
